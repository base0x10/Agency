# Agency
A set of frameworks, algorithms, and implementations for rational agents in combinatorial games

Currently, I have a framework for deterministic sequential zero-sum games.  Most of Minimax algorithm is implemented for these games.

I have implemented TicTacToe on an NxN game board with an arbitrary length win condition.  An agent on this modeled game uses the minimax algorithm for my zero-sum game framework.  

Here are a few combinatorial games and algorithms/frameworks I would like to implement:

Nim
Connect Four
Conway's surreal number representation of games
Go (at least end games of a small size)
